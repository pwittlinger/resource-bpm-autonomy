# resource-bpm-autonomy

This repo is intended to integrate a resource perspective into the framed autonomy setting originally proposed by [Acitelli et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2025.102573).
The core idea is that given a set of prefixes (1..n), an automated planner finds an initial task- and resource- allocation, which is then refined by iteration alongside a CP scheduler.

## Framed Autonomy

The source code of the implementation for the framed autonomy approach can be found at this [git repository](https://github.com/pwittlinger/data-framed-autonomy/tree/resource-alloc).
